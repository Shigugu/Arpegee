A simple arcade game

Arcade game:  
Mini game #1:  
Player is a brick 2 cases tall.  
Must avoid enemies charging at it at different speeds, and at different heights.  
Player can jump from 1 to 3 cases high, and can duck (moves slower while ducking), and can move laterally.  
Goal: survive 30sec  
Each lvl comes with a new rule.  

New rules:  
-	Player must walk on a button to end the lvl (button appears after 30sec)  
-	Enemies can be 2 cases long or 2 cases high.  
-	Speed is doubled

Story (coming with assets):  
You’re a scarecrow in a field. Birds got sick of being afraid by a mere pumpkin on a stick, and chose to fight for the sake of their starving children.  
You’ve met with a terrible fate, haven’t you? You’d better run for your life, and avoid those angry volatiles.  


Prototype:

This is a plateform game, you play a scarecrow in a flat field in 2 dimensions. Birds come at you from both directions, at different heights.
You goal is to survive for a given time. You can avoid incoming birds by ducking, jumping, and you can walk in both directions.
Birds fly in a straight line, at first they don't change the height of their flight, and keep the same speed as they had when they spawned.
Birds can spawn with different height and different speed, making the player's life harder.
The player can't defeat ennemies, if they get touched by one of them, it's game over (or they just lose 1 life, and they have 3 lives per game).
Birds fly from one side of the screen to the other.
